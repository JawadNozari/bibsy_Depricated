## Introduction


A user-friendly library system aimed mostly towards schools and educators. 
bibsy is largely made up of basic functions that are necessary yet effective in a library system. bibsy enables efficient use of a library system by allowing users to register books and identify which ones need to be returned.

This idea arose from a school assignment in which we wanted an efficient library system that could be utilized in place of an older one that was less user-friendly and effective. 

The aim of this project is to replace the older library system for the teachers to use effectively. 

## Features

All of the information provided below is acquired via a database (MySQL) , which is updated when changes are made.

The site will initially prompt you for your login details. To maintain security, all login information is encrypted and kept in a database.

In this section, I will present the eight functionalities in this project that are essential in a library system:

- Staff: As the name implies, this displays all of the educators and administrators in the school who have the ability to borrow books.

- Students: Shows all the students in a list style format.

- Dashboard: The dashboard is exactly what the name implies, and it serves as the main page of the website. A website featuring four larger icons that help users to navigate the site. This is crucial as it improves user-friendliness.

- Staff: The staff feature displays the instructors in charge of the library. The essential contact information, such as name, email address, and phone number, is also provided in this function.

- Books: Displays all of the books in a list format. All of the books include those in the library as well as those that have currently been borrowed.

- Available: This feature displays all of the books that are currently available for borrowing in the library. Basic data, such as the quantity, is also readily available.

- Borrowed: This function displays all of the books that have been borrowed as well as the due dates and the individual who borrowed the book.

- Missing: This function shows which books have passed their due dates and therefore shouldÂ be returned.


## Implementation

This website was developed with the following resources/dependencies:

- Prisma with MySQL (v3.9.2)

- Express (v4.17.2)

- Nodemon (v2.0.15)

- React

- TypeScript

- Axios

- Tailwind CSS

We also built an unique custom API that collects book information from the internet and stores it in our database.

The usage procedure is straightforward. To see and utilize the site, all you need is internet connectivity and a web browser. 

Login is also required to make changes in the database, which is all related with the library system and the fundamentals.
